100% DM-based project to implement in DM.

What is DM? 
DM is a C based programming language started by the developers Dan and Tom at byond.com in around the year 2000. \n
If you are around the shady part of youtube, you'll recognize Byond as the home of Space Station 13 (yes, somehow DM worked out for it.) \n
DM is completely focused on multiplayer game development. <\p>
Dream Maker (the app for DM) has an integrated compiler, interpreter, and tools for map-making and sprite-drawing. \n 
Dream Seeker is its client for joining the multiplayer (or downloading the singeplayer) games.\n
Dream Daemon is the hosting server for your games. \n
Yes, the names are super cool. \n
