100% DM-based project to implement in DM.

What is DM? 
DM is a C based programming language started by the developers Dan and Tom at byond.com in around the year 2000. <p>
If you are around the shady part of youtube, you'll recognize Byond as the home of Space Station 13 (yes, somehow DM worked out for it.) <p>
DM is completely focused on multiplayer game development. <p>
Dream Maker (the app for DM) has an integrated compiler, interpreter, and tools for map-making and sprite-drawing. <p>
Dream Seeker is its client for joining the multiplayer (or downloading the singeplayer) games.<p>
Dream Daemon is the hosting server for your games. <p>
Yes, the names are super cool. <p>
-How to play this on your own computer/host it?- <p>
Easy. You either clone the repo, or just download the .dmb. Then you can use Dream Seeker to just play it solo, or Dream Daemon to host it before using dream seeker to play.

Aim:<p>
Fully-fledged multiplayer 2d-fighter with some scuffed physics (jumping, knockback.)

Done so far:<p>Simple Knockback<p>Attacking and damaging<p>Movement<p>NPC AI (Stalks and attacks you with knockback)<p>Items, item effects, item interaction.<p>Dungeons & Dragons stat system<p>Dungeons & Dragons attack mechanics, with advantages/disadvantages, critical hits. (still not turn-based. might never be.)
